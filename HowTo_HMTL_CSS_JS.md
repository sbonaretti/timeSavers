# How to: HTML, CSS, and JS

Definitions:  
- [HTML](#html) is to create a structure to a page - we say what things are   
- CSS is for the style  
- JavaScript is for interaction and adding changes to the page  


## HTML  
- Basic snapshot:  
  ```
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  
  <head>
     <title>Page title</title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
      <h1>First heading</h1>
      <p>First paragraph</p1>
  </body>
  
  </html>
  ```
